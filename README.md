I feel that market demand has slightly shifted the programming paradigm, where direct model programming is no longer commonly practiced.

I feel that the practices and demands of software, which are mostly geared towards business needs, have made **Business Modeling** a mainstream approach and, for some reason, it has now become the backbone of most software architectures.  

Take "Clean Architecture" as an example. Clean Architecture is essentially a form of Business Modeling that prioritizes the transaction process of objects in its design.  

The question, *"When should Clean Architecture be used?"* is one I encounter very often, and the answers are often unsatisfying. Many software developers even consider Clean Architecture the best approach to building software without fully understanding the concept of modeling.  

Of course, for business-oriented software, Clean Architecture is a very reasonable concept. After all, at its core, Clean Architecture is itself a form of Business Modeling.  

However, most answers you'll find tend to highlight how Clean Architecture works rather than emphasizing the concept of **modeling** in software itself.  

Because of this, I want to revisit a fundamental concept in programming: **Modeling**. I aim to achieve this by exploring and testing direct modeling methods using Kotlin.
I am creating this project to try and re-evaluate the Direct Model programming approach in the Kotlin language.

# Theory
- **Modeling** is an approach to understanding, designing, and representing systems using **models**. A model is an abstract representation of reality used to explain or simulate how a system works.
- A model is an artificial object created with behavior, purpose, and characteristics.
- A model is not merely a **Record of Values**, but rather the entire mechanism, attributes, and properties.

However, I understand that in more complex systems, abstraction layers are necessary to manage dependencies, improve scalability, and maintain flexibility. In this experiment, I want to explore how Direct Modeling can address those challenges.
